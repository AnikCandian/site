    <p>This is just a normal paragraph in its natural habitat. Boring, isn't it. Let's give it a controlled shock, if you don't mind. We sell various items, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Coffee</li>
      <li>Not Coffee</li>
      <li>Something regarding coffee</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also do custom orders. Call us if you have one!</p>
